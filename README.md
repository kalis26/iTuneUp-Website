# iTuneUp Website
This is the official website for iTuneUp, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and modern frontend tools.

Its purpose is to present and document the iTuneUp Windows app — a tool that lets you:
- Create a local music library in .m4a format
- Enrich tracks with official Apple metadata
- Source content in the best quality from YouTube
- Enjoy an Apple Music–compatible collection

The site also provides links to full documentation, downloads, and GitHub issues for support.
